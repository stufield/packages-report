# WTF Packages Report
A repo from the WFT-workshop at RStudio Conf 2019 with Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester
that contains a simple report describing the packages I `r Sys.getenv("USER")`
have on my machine.

## Polished `Pages` URL here
[]()

### Recall what this does
```
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

## Analysis
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# here are the add-on packages
add_ons <- here("data", "add-on-packages.csv") %>% read_csv()
add_ons
```

I have `r nrow(add_ons)` add-on packages installed.

Here's how they break down in terms of which version of R they were built 
under, which is related to how recently they were updated on `CRAN`.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# here are the frequencies of the add-on packages
here("data", "add-on-packages-freqtable.csv") %>% read_csv()
```

### Flow of the analysis

Run [R/make-clean.R](R/make-clean.R) to clean out downstream products, i.e.
directories containing the generated `*.csv` and `*.png` files.

Run [R/driver.R](R/driver.R) to re-run the analysis and re-render this `README`.
